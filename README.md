Berkeley Data Analytics Homework 12 Web Visualization Dashboard (Lattitude)

Using bootstrap, CSS and HTML, I have created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations .png with individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages  contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations and  a landing page, where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website consist of 7 pages total, including:
A landing page containing:
An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.
Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.


A "Data" page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table must be a bootstrap table component.
The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. You may use a csv-to-html table conversion tool, e.g. ConvertCSV.
